    <h1>Who Am I</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Corbin Grossen, an AWS Cloud Engineer with experience in IaC and CaC tools like Terraform and Ansible. I focus on concept design and the deployment of highly configurable, scalable, and available architectures. I'm most comfortable with AWS-hosted backend environments and tools like Terraform, API Gateway, Lambda, CloudFront, and EC2.</p>

    <h1>How I Started</h1>
    <p>My journey began when I was 14, tinkering with small projects at school and work. It started with learning JSON and YAML to create addons for the games I played at the time. Shortly after, I began learning the basics of various programming and scripting languages like Python and Bash through Udemy courses. Fast forward to 18, I'm pursuing an Associate's Degree in Cyber Security at Coastal Pines, taking a Networking class with an emphasis on CISCO, and I just fell in love. After discovering my passion for networking, I researched further and enrolled in the "AWS for Jobs" program at YellowTail Tech.</p>

    <h1>What I'm Doing Now</h1>
    <p>Fast forward to now, I am an AWS Certified SysOps Administrator and couldn't be happier with the knowledge I've gained over the years. For the past 2 years, I've focused on learning and self-discipline. When I'm not geeking out on whatever project I'm working on, I'm at the gym, either working out or boxing. While not directly relevant to my professional life, this commitment has noticeably improved my attitude and approach to troubleshooting issues, thanks to my growth in self-discipline.</p>

    <h1>My Objectives</h1>
    <p>With new certifications emerging every year and fresh ideas popping into my head daily, my current goal is to release more projects to the public and obtain more certifications. This will not only challenge my skillset and knowledge but also better showcase my abilities to potential interests.</p>
