#### This is a blog post about the consequences of relying on abstraction and the so-called term "ClickOps".
<br />
Let me start this off by saying that I personally think "ClickOps" can be convenient for someone new to the tool/platform that they are learning. However, it should only ever be used as a stepping stone and NOT a final destination. I was lucky in the fact that I understood this when going into AWS and chose not to spend more than warrented time "clicking around".
